# Overview

My plan was to create a fun tic tac toe game in C++. As a software engineer major, I would like to strengthen my interests in game development. After a lot of trial and error with figuring out a proper IDE,the software that I chose to program my C++ assingment in was Visual Studio Community 2022.
